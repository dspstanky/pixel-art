# Pixel Art

## Introduction

This plugin was developed as a learning excercise, utilizing the concepts and algorithms presented in Acerola's Color Quantization and Dithering video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wOUe32Pt-E

If you're seeing this line of text, you're here before i've made an actual release and updated the readme accordingly.

haha i have never released anything before i'm sure i'll figure it out eventually and i'll only pull a few hairs from my head.

### Notes

As stated before, this plugin was done as a learning excercise. I have plans to expand on it, as well as optimize, however it may not be a high priority so updates will be made when possible and motivated.

### Usage

* Right click any source (image, video, etc), and select `Filters`
* In the filters menu, press the `+` button to add a new filter
* Select `Pixel Art`
* Play with settings to your hearts content
    * The `Dithering` section will help add back in some detail after you've downscaled your source
    * The `Color Count` options will reduce the variations in color shade for each primary color.


### Build Instructions

To build this code use the included scripts that are taken from the [OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate).
